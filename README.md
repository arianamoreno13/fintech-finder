## Description

The objective of this application is to create a cryptocurrency payment system. Although it is currently in the development stage, a testnet is being used instead of actual Ethereum transfers. However, the system's functionality is fully implemented. It is integrated with the process of hiring a Fintech Professional from a pool of candidates.
